Some of the early performers were the Dollu Kunitha and Jazz Revival. As the night wore on, the performances simply got better and better.  The Baul contemporary folk band Oikyotaan and Bharat Sargam Quawali who performed around 3AM drove the crowd into a frenzy with their lively music.  As the first rays of the returning sun pierced the grey mist of the morning sky, Sumathi Murthy&#39;s poignant voice urged those in the sleepy audience to &#39;jaago re&#39;.  The sunlight glinted across the lake behind the banyan tree, suddenly lending a dream like setting to the stage, and bringing a fitting end to a splendid night of fine music.">
