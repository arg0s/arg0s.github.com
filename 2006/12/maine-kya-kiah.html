<meta name="description" content="Melanie organized a fun carol singing event at work last week. Although I joined the first days practice, a bad throat infection kept me out through the rest of the week and although they amicably invited me to the final performance, all I could do was be the echo on &#39;Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer&#39;.&quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (Echo: Reindeer)Had a very shiny noseAnd if you ever saw itYou would even say it glows (Echo: Like a lightbulb!)&quot;With Nihar on the guitar, and Babu on the drums, we had a fun ensemble together. We also sang a fun variant of the 12 Indian days of Christmas.Monami got a holidays gift set of yum Ghirardelli chocolates.And oh, last Sunday, we went by Kiah&#39;s jewelery store outlet and picked rings for each other. I chose a band (No, not really LOTR inspired). She chose a &#39;knot&#39; with 44 little diamonds.">
