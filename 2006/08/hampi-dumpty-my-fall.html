<meta name="description" content="That&#39;s a small gash I had from my bike fall. Not seen in the picture - I had bruises on my arm, knee and shoulder, which took a couple of weeks to heal. My most livid memory was the emergency trip we had to make to the only doctor in Hampi - the temple doctor. She didn&#39;t have real bandages - they had to tie pieces together, and the only medicine available was a strange raw tincture. My gash on my left arm wasn&#39;t deep, but had sheared away quite a bit of skin. When her swab of tincture hit my arm, I was shrieking madly in agony.Lesson learnt the hard way: Traveling? Carry some Savlon wherever you go.Monami and I by the Virupaksha Temple, adjacent to the Hampi Bazaar.Make sure you visit Mango Tree if you visit Hampi.Mr. Batman arrived unsolicited, flying blind, nose diving and passing out on the ground right by where we were sitting. Yes, we freaked out.On the second day we were there, the dam gates had been opened, and the water level of the Tunghabadra river had risen over 30 feet, leaving the little teashop by the Ram temple underwater. We were there just the day before, enjoying a cuppa and the view.The rise of the river water pushed the zillions of the bugs by the bank into the Mango Tree restaurant waterfront area, scaring away several tourists, but offering some fine pictures.Well, there&#39;s a lot more to write home about my Hampi trip, but I&#39;ll save that for a separate post later.">
